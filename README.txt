A simple blog site. On index page, there is a button that that takes you to a page where you can write a title and the main content for your blog. 
The title and content are stored in a database if both of the text fields have text and you press "add post". If there are posts in the database, they are partly displayed on the index page.
On the "displaycards" on the index page you can click "read more" which takes you to the full blogpost. There is also delete and edit buttons, but they are still in progress.
